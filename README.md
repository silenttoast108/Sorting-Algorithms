The program “sorting-algorithms” is intended to replicate the use of different sorting algorithms to schedule in memory. 
It works by accepting numerical values in the file “ejemplo.txt” formatted as <process><instant of arrival><memory required><time required for execution> for each process. 
The user will then be prompted to enter either 1 or 0 for worst fit and best fit respectively. The program will then write a file that shows the use of memory over time. 
Additionally, it will graphically display the use of memory over time in the terminal.
